# Broken App Issues

Used const instead of var.

Used express.json() to parse the JSON request body.

Used async/await and Promise.all to handle asynchronous operations correctly.

Changed res.send(JSON.stringify(out)) to res.json(results) for cleaner JSON response handling.

Added error handling with try/catch and next(err) to handle exceptions properly.
